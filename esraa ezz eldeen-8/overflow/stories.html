            <h2>Why The Cricket Chirps</h2>
            <p>
              Before there were seasons, the cricket could fly. He flew faster
              than the bumblebee. He flew higher than the falcon. And he flew
              fancier than the flying marmaduck (who was quite a fancy flier).
              The cricket had flown all over the world. He flew to the East.
              Then he flew to the West. And then he flew to the South. But he
              had never flown North. The ant tried to warn him that he should
              not try. “It’s very cold up north,” said the Ant. “Too cold for an
              ant and too cold for a cricket.” The cricket, however, did not
              listen, because crickets do whatever they want. He set off for the
              North that very night. It did not take him long to get there
              because he was such a fantastically fast and fancy flier. The
              cricket landed next to a pine tree as the sun began setting. There
              was snow everywhere he looked. There was snow on the trees. There
              was snow on the ground. And there was snow on top of the
              mountains. The Moose came walking over to him very slowly.
              “Ohhhh…Hello,” said the moose. “Bundle up, nighttime is coming.”
              The cricket did not listen, because crickets do whatever they
              want. He flew up into a pine tree to settle in for a good sleep.
              He did this quickly because he is such an incredibly fast and
              fancy flier. The Owl came flying over to the same branch. “You
              should find some shelter from the cold night,” said the owl. The
              cricket did not listen, because crickets do whatever they want. He
              decided to rest on a pile of twigs. He was sleepier than he had
              ever been, from all the remarkably fast and fancy flying. The
              cricket slept all through the night until morning. When he woke up
              he was ready to go home and tell the ant about his trip. He hopped
              high in the air to start flying, but he couldn’t. Instead he fell
              right back into the snow. He hopped again, even higher this time,
              but his wings would not work. They had frozen solid during the
              cold night. He tried to warm them up by rubbing them together but
              it was no use. The cricket had to hop all the way home. It took
              him days and days to return. By the time he got back, his wings
              had almost become unfrozen. When he rubbed them together this
              time, they made a chirping noise that no one in the forest had
              ever heard before. And every time he rubbed his wings together
              they chirped a little bit louder and got a little less frozen. But
              it is important to know, dear reader, that wings are special and
              fragile things. This is why the greatest care should always be
              taken around them. They are not meant to be frozen, and once they
              are, they may never be the same again. Even though the cricket’s
              wings were no longer frozen, he still could not fly. And ever
              since then the cricket stays on the ground like his friend the
              ant, and hops from place to place. And now the cricket is the
              fastest and fanciest hopper there is. At nighttime, you can hear
              him chirping, from rubbing his wings together to keep warm. But he
              is doing much more than just that… The cricket is telling you how
              warm or cold it is by chirping. He chirps faster when it is warm,
              and slower when it is cold. This way, you will not make the same
              mistake that he did. However, that is only if you decide to
              listen…

            <h2>The Story of Yes and No</h2>
            <p>
              Before words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village
              in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best,
              smartest and most liked person in his village. Yes had a brother,
              and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was
              not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No
              for help, he refused because he didn’t like people very much.
              Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and
              he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.
              One day Yes and No’s father, Okay went on a long journey and he
              left his two sons in charge of all the animals. Yes took good care
              of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in
              mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were
              very old animals, so you might know them by different names
              today.] No didn’t want to be bothered with the boring tasks
              involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping
              his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the
              water. A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to
              watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat.
              Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and
              forgot about the yock. It just so happened that the King had a
              personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often. So often, that
              when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s
              carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it. The
              King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt
              himself. The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been
              allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an
              explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire
              story. The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an
              idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the
              castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later
              referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in
              the Kingdom’s history. The King needed help with many things
              around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily
              tasks involved with running a Kingdom. However, soon after his
              decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes
              would be of any use to him as a servant. Whenever the King asked
              No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or
              eaten, without exception. The King was quite sure that No was the
              worst servant in the entire world.

            <h2>When Do Hippos Play?</h2>
            <p>
              By the African river, know as the Nile, The sun fell away and it
              rested a while. The rhinos had braved all the smoldering heat.
              They lay down to sleep as they wiped off their feet. The elephants
              marched to their elephant beds, And gently they rested their
              elephant heads. The hippos went bathing in cool, shallow pools,
              Thinking the rhinos and elephants fools. Slowly the hippos sank
              into the river, The water so cold that it gave them a shiver.
              (Hippos can't swim, like the pelicans think. They also can't
              float- they could easily sink.) Underwater, they fell to the soft
              river bed, On darkish green plants with a smidgen of red. They
              strolled on the bottom, then bounced up for air. They did it for
              hours, without any care. The fish followed closely, and wove in an
              out, Under their belly, and up to their snout. Each of the hippos
              came up to the shore, To feed on the grass by the river once more.
              They dried off their bodies by shaking and stomping, And took
              bites of grass, chewing and chomping. With night fading fast, they
              were full from the feast. The sun returned back, rising up from
              the east. The hippos crept off to collapse for the day, While
              rhinos and elephants got up to play. Enjoying the warmth of the
              sun and its light, Never knowing the story of hippos at night.
